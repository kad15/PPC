{2 Presentation}

This is a programming exercise. The aim is to implement an A* algorithm and to test it on a path-finding problem consisting in finding the shortest path between origin and destination while avoiding obstacles.

{2 Installation}

Download file [tdastar.zip] (or [.tgz] or [.gz]).


Decompress the file using [unzip], [tar -zxf], or [gunzip], depending on the file type.

Go to sub-directory [Astar] and compile using command :
{v
> make
v}

This command creates an executable file [findpath] and an HTML documentation that can be found in subdirectory [./doc/]

{2 Usage }

Run the program :
{v
> ./findpath
v}

Run the test program in "slow motion" :
{v
> ./findpath -s
v}


{2 Work to be done}

1) Open file [astar.ml] and implement the A* search algorithm. You may need the types and functions provided in modules {!Pqueue} and {!Memory}

2) Open file [main.ml], implement the functions that should be given as arguments to {!Astar.search} in order to test your A* algorithm on the path-finding problem provided in module {!Problem}

3) Test your program. Try it with the following heuristic function : [fun v -> 0.]. What happens ?  What kind of tree search is performed in that case ?

4) How could you modify your code to perform a depth-first search ? Would that be more efficient ?
